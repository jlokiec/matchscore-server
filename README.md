# matchscore-server

Server app for MatchScore project.

# email configuration

Before starting the app, configure Spring Boot Mail. If you will use GMail account, you just need to set `spring.mail.username` and `spring.mail.password` variables in `application.properties` file. Otherwise, you might need to change other `spring.mail` variables. If you are using GMail account and having some troubles with authentication, read [this article](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255).
